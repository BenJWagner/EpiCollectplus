{"name":"Epicollectplus","tagline":"The next generation of EpiCollect, multiple forms, more fields and more control. We recommend using Apache 2.2 or later, PHP 5.3 or later and MySQL 5.5 or later.","body":"## Welcome to Epicollect+.\r\nEpiCollect+ (plus) provides a complete solution for complex mobile data gathering projects and consists of two parts:\r\n### 1 Mobile app\r\nThe EpiCollect+ mobile app allows you to load a single or multiple projects and provides the interface for users to gather the data you specify. All data can be subsequently synched with a central server and, furthermore, data can be retrieved onto the mobile devices from the central server and viewed as tables or maps.\r\n### 2 Web Server App\r\nWe provide hosting for project data, however we also provide server software and instructions for setting up a database(s) and web application for you to house and view the data collected by any number of mobile devices (you can also enter data directly via the web). All data submitted from multiple devices can be viewed as tables / maps (if location data included) and downloaded for further analysis.\r\n\r\n## Your data gathering project\r\nA data gathering project can be thought of as consisting of one or more forms (i.e. questionnaires) which you define.\r\nA form can consist of one or more fields ( i.e. questions - plain text, dropdown lists, checkboxes etc) and you can also define one or more media fields (GPS, photos, videos, audio or barcode scans) to be attached to a form. You can also define validation, form logic (skip questions) and linking of forms (in a hierarchy or branching) within a project.\r\n\r\n![Forms Overview](http://www.epicollect.net/plus_images/overview_forms.png)\r\n![Fields Overview](http://www.epicollect.net/plus_images/overview_fields.png)\r\n\r\nA user can complete multiple instances of a form or set of linked forms (entries) on a mobile device prior to synchronisation (sending a copy of data) to a central server.\r\nData at the central server (text and/or media) can be viewed as tables and (if location data are recorded) using Google maps and all data can be downloaded for further processing in a number of formats.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note: EpiCollect+ uses data networks (2G/3G/4G or wireless) for data exchange. However, a data connection IS NOT required for data gathering and is only needed when loading a project onto a mobile device and for synchronising data. This allows data gathering to proceded in areas without data coverage (ie remote areas).**\r\n\r\n### A Quick Start Guide:\r\n1. Install the EpiCollect+ app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.ac.imperial.epi_collect2&hl=en_GB)\r\n2. Open, tap 'Start data collection' , fill in our demo project form (as many times as you like) and synchronise data.\r\n3. View data at http://plus.epicollect.net/demoproject\r\n\r\n\r\n### A slightly less Quick start Guide\r\nHere we detail how to create a project at http://plus.epicollect.net\r\nOur online form Builder allows you to design your project form(s) using an intuitive drag and drop interface. Forms can contain any number of text fields (eg dropdowns, plain text, )and or media fields (eg photo, video, sound clips etc). You can also specify form logic (eg jump questions) and validation (eg required, numeric / date, regular expressions etc). Furthermore, you can link multiple forms together within a project (in a hierarchy or branching).\r\n#### Android\r\nHere we detail how to use the EpiCollect+ Android app\r\nInstalling and loading a project, filling in of one or multiple forms, synching data to your project website and more.\r\n\t \r\n#### plus.epicollect.net\r\nHere we detail how to use your project website.\r\nYour project website allows you to view all data gathered within a project as tables and maps (if location data collected). You can chart and all data are available to download and furthermore, you can add new entries directly at the website, extending the reach of your project beyond just mobile devices.\r\n\r\n#### Developers\r\nHere we detail the EpiCollect Markup Language (ecml) which is a vocabulary of XML used for defining projects and forms and also how to setup and manage servers.\r\nWe also detail the EpiCollect+ Server allowing you to download and setup your own server(s) / databases, create and roll out projects to multiple mobile devices. Manage project access for administrators, curators and users.","google":"UA-38666810-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
